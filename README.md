# 🛒 Amazon Clone 💻

📌 **Overview**

This project is a functional and visually appealing clone of the Amazon homepage built using HTML and CSS. It was created to understand the structure and layout of a modern e-commerce website and to practice responsive web design, reusable components, and navigation techniques.

The design mimics the core elements of Amazon’s landing page—such as the navbar, hero section, category cards, and footer—giving a realistic touch for educational purposes.
